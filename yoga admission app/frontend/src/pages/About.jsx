<h2 style={headingStyle}>Teacher Training Program at" THE YOGA STUDIO "</h2>
<Paragraph>
Yoga is a practice that is constantly evolving, which is why we offer opportunities to continue exploring the most up-to-date approaches. Whether you set out to understand an aspect of yoga unfamiliar to you or gain another perspective on a topic, continuing to learn is crucial to your success as a teacher.

The Yoga Studio invites you to advance your practice to support your own self-care and healing, develop your teaching skills and learn from some of the most effective yoga teachers.

We are committed to providing a diverse learning environment that equips our students with the skills that can bring about personal and community change. Teacher trainers are also respectful that students often have different learning styles, and we all do our best to teach effectively with this in mind.

We believe the practice of yoga and meditation helps students gain a better understanding of their unique skills and abilities, enabling them to find a more meaningful engagement with their friends, family, and community.

Our program is unique among teachers' programs in our commitment to cultivating yoga students across a range of experiences, regardless of age, culture or physical ability.

Students in our program will have both the opportunity to observe classes in clinical, community and other settings and, with the teacher’s permission, serve as class assistants. In doing so, they begin to develop skills that enable them not only to work with specific communities, but also to adapt those skills for other student populations.

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Mission</h2>
      <Paragraph>
      The mission is to spread the teachings of classical yoga, integrating the Four Paths of Yoga through the Five Points of Yoga of Swami Vishnudevananda into a means to achieve physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing, and self-realisation. We uphold the practice of all aspects of the classical teachings of a synthesis of yoga with a strong emphasis on practical experience. Swami Sivananda’s dictum ‘an ounce of practice is worth tons of theory’ is strictly followed. Many of the teachers dedicate their lives to the study and practise of yoga, living within the Organisation as renunciants or swamis.
      </Paragraph>
      <h2 style={headingStyle}>The Lineage</h2>
      <Paragraph>In Rishikesh, meanwhile, an increasing number of disciples had begun to congregate and an ashram grew up around him. With his unrestrained generosity, spirit of service, deep devotion, and his constant good humour, Swami Sivananda set a supreme example to his students. In 1932, he started the Sivananda Ashram; in 1936 the Divine Life Society was born. The Yoga Vedanta Forest Academy was organised in 1948, all with the aim of spreading the teachings of yoga and vedanta.

Swami Sivananda’s teachings crystallised the basic tenets of all religions, combining all yoga paths into one – the Yoga of Synthesis which he summed up with, ‘Serve, Love, Give, Purify, Meditate, Realise’. His own life was a shining example of the ideal wish to spread his message of love and service. He had disciples around the world, of all nationalities, religions and creeds. Swami Sivananda entered mahasamadhi (left his physical body) on July 14, 1963.</Paragraph>
